# Greedy-Algorithms
Makes use of Greedy Algorithms, that being algorithms that sort data in a specific way.

Assign Mice to Holes
This allows us to put a particular mouse close to the corresponding hole in the holes list.
We can then find the maximum difference between the mice and the corresponding hole position to determine how much time to get there.

Fractionl Knapsack
The key to this is to keep in mind which data in your array will bring you the most profit.
My data can be divided if it is divisible.
We are given weights in the values of n items, and we need to put them in a knapsack of capacity w, in such a way to get the maximum value of the knapsack.
